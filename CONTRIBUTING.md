### Taking on Tasks
There is TODO tasks mentioned in a README.md file
and We have a growing task list of
[issues](https://github.com/hieudo-dev/spotify-next/issues). Find an issue that
appeals to you and make a comment that you'd like to work on it. Include in your
comment a brief description of how you'll solve the problem and if there are any
open questions you want to discuss. Once a project coordinator has assigned the
issue to you, start working on it.

### Submitting Work
To make
contributions smoothly we recommend the following:

1.  [Fork this project repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    and clone it to your local machine. (Read more
    [About Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks))
2.  Before working on any changes, try to
    [sync the forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
    to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.
3.  On a
    [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
    in your fork (aka a "feature branch" and not `main`) work on a small focused
    change that only touches on a few files.
4.  Run `pre-commit` and make sure all files have formatting fixed. This
    simplifies life for reviewers.
5.  Package up a small bit of work that solves part of the problem
    [into a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
    and
    [send it out for review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
    [Here](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/pull/658) is an example PR
    for this project to illustrate this flow.
6.  If you're lucky, we can merge your change into `main` without any problems.
